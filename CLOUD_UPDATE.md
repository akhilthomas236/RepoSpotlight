# Cloud Migration Update

## Changes Made

1. Replaced Deta Space with Firebase Firestore as the cloud storage solution
   - Created `firebase_database.py` which implements all required database functions
   - Updated configuration to support Firebase credentials

2. Updated requirements.txt
   - Added firebase-admin dependency
   - Removed deta dependency

3. Updated database configuration in db_config.py
   - Automatic switching between local SQLite and cloud Firebase
   - Support for various credential storage methods

4. Enhanced app.py database initialization
   - Made sure initialize_db works with both SQLite and Firebase
   - Added better error handling

5. Created migration utilities
   - `migrate_to_firebase.py` for migrating existing data
   - `db_tools.py` for command-line database management

6. Updated documentation
   - Updated README.md with Firebase deployment instructions
   - Created firebase_setup_guide.md with local testing instructions
   - Updated .gitignore to protect Firebase credentials

## How to Use

### Local Development

1. Continue using SQLite for local development (default)
2. When ready to test cloud storage:
   - Create a Firebase project and get credentials
   - Update .streamlit/secrets.toml with Firebase credentials
   - Set USE_CLOUD_DB = true

### Deployment

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Configure Streamlit Cloud secrets with Firebase credentials
3. Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud

### Data Migration

To migrate existing data from SQLite to Firebase:

```bash
# Option 1: Using the migration script directly
python migrate_to_firebase.py

# Option 2: Using the command-line tool
python db_tools.py migrate

# Check database info
python db_tools.py info
```

## Benefits of Firebase

- Free tier with generous limits
- Real-time database capabilities
- Excellent security and scalability
- Native integration with Google Cloud
- Well-maintained SDK with good documentation
